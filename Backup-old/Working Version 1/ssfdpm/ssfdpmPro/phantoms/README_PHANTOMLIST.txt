Guide to the phantoms

(1) phantom
This was the original phantom file made by an old HArvey Mudd student.  Used primarilly at 
the beginning of the modern breast program (ie, post Albert).

(2) phantoma
This is the original MEDLITE phantom.  The old text file used to be newphantom, since renamed
to correspond to the phantom file name.

(3) ph series (PH010, PH011, PH012, PH013)
These were all made by MEDLITE and are essentially the same thing.

(4) iss series (iss1, iss2, iss3, iss4)
All made by iss.  There are two kinds, 1/3 and 2/4 are essentiall the same ones.

ph010 is just ph013 copied for now
